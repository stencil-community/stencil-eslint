# @stencil-community/eslint-plugin

ESLint rules specific to Stencil JS projects.

## Installation

If you're using npm v7+, you only need to install this package. Its peer dependencies will be automatically installed.
```bash
npm i --save-dev @stencil-community/eslint-plugin
```

If you're using npm v6 or lower, you will need to install this package and its peer dependencies in your stencil project:

```bash
npm i --save-dev eslint @typescript-eslint/parser @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin eslint-plugin-react @stencil-community/eslint-plugin typescript
```

## Usage

`.eslintrc.json` configuration file:

```json
{
  "parserOptions": {
    "project": "./tsconfig.json"
  },
  "extends": [
    "plugin:@stencil-community/recommended"
  ]
}
```

Add a new `lint` script to the `package.json`:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "lint": "eslint src/**/*{.ts,.tsx}"
  }
}
```

By default, ESLint will ignore your `node_modules/` directory. Consider adding a `.eslintignore` file at the root of
your project with any output target directories to avoid false positive errors from ESLint.
```
# place any directories created by the Stencil compilation process here
dist
loader
www
```

Lint all your project:
```
npm run lint
```
